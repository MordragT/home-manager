System and home-manager configuration for my linux machines.

## üì¶ Contents

- `system/config/`: Machine specific configurations
- `system/modules/`: Nixos modules
- `home/config/`: Home-Manager configurations
- `home/modules/`: Home-Manager modules
- `pkgs/`: Overlays for various packages

## üöÄ How to use ?

You probably want to use flakes to use the overlay and modules defined in this repo.

TODO: Show some basic examples on how to use the overlay/modules

### Install on new system

1. Create partitions as per your requirements (e.g., using disko or parted).
2. Mount the partitions, excluding any tmpfs partitions.
3. Comment out the machine-id under impermanence.
4. Run the nixos-install command.
5. Copy the machine-id and other necessary files into the persisted directories.
6. Uncomment the machine-id.
7. Run the nixos-install command again.


```bash
nix-shell -p git
sudo nixos-install --flake uri#system
```

## ‚ú® Features

### ü§´ Impermanence

Instead of tediously specifying all the files you want to keep, the `environment.state` module allows you to specify only the folders you want to overlay by symlink or by mount.
Say you have folders under `/nix/state/users/name/data` where you have all the folders which sadly do not follow the XDG directories like `.ssh` or `.minecraft` and you have
your home folders like `Desktop` or `Documents` under `/nix/state/users/name/home`. Then you can specify the following config:

```nix
# system/config/<machine>/impermanence.nix
environment.state = {
    enable = true;
    targets = [
        {
            source = "/nix/state/users/name/home";
            destination = "/home/name";
            method = "mount";
            owner = "name";
            group = "users";
            mode = "0700";
        }
        {
            source = "/nix/state/users/name/data";
            destination = "/home/name";
            method = "mount";
            owner = "name";
            group = "users";
            mode = "0700";
        }
    ];
}
```

Now to include the right folders you can just put an **@** behind every folder you want to overlay into the destination.
For example your folder structure might look like the following:

```
/nix/state/users/name/home
    - Desktop@
    - Documents@
        - important_stuff
        - inner_folder
    - some_other_folder
```

Now `Desktop@` and `Documents@` will be mounted/symlinked at startup to your home folders `Desktop` and `Documents`

### ü¶ä Firefox Addons

Under `pkgs/by-scope/firefox-addons` are a bunch of firefox addons defined. But instead of manually creating derivations for each addon,
the addons are generated via the `pkgs/by-scope/firefox-addons/mod.nu` nushell script. The resulting `default.lock` is then used to create
the respective derivations.

Now to add addons you can just add the slugs into the `pkgs/by-scope/firefox-addons/mod.nu` script and recreate the `default.lock` file
by running `just update`

*Disclaimer*: Due to some limitations of nushell, at the moment the path of `default.lock` is hardcoded into `pkgs/by-scope/firefox-addons/mod.nu`.
    You ~~might~~ probably want to change that

### üíª Vscode Extensions

The vscode extensions are very similar to the firefox addons and are defined under `pkgs/by-scope/vscode-extensions`.
The **disclaimer** also applies!

### üöß WIP Intel OneAPI

In an effort to make the *Intel Extension for Pytorch* work, I created a multitude of packages.
Under `pkgs/by-scope` and `pkgs/by-name` are lying the intel oneapi packages like *dpcpp* or *mkl*.

To use the dpcpp compiler you may want to use `dpcppStdenv`, which is currently somewhat functional.

### üõë Other packages

There exist some packages in this repository which are not functional at the moment. I still keep them in here as documentation for future packaging efforts.
I try to mark them as broken but I might have forgotten some. If you encounter any broken packages please create an issue.
